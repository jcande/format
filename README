I was writing exploits for outdated wargames and didn't have direct parameter
access ($). I decided to automate the process and out came this script.

You tell it the style you want to write (char, short, int), where to write, and
what to write (can be more than a word, i.e., shellcode). It then does so.

This doesn't use Captain Planet's technique of getting around fortified code
but any patches are welcome.

Also, I tested it a bit, but only the 2-byte write parts so it could have some
show stopping bugs. Anyway, I hope it's useful to someone out there.
